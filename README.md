# MachineLearningPhw1-2
This program is machine Learning assignment programming homework 1, 2

1. phw-1 file is find the best model and best parameters and best scalers and best encoder

The dataset is breast-cancer dataset 
Id and feature1~9 are feature attributes, target is target value (categorical column)
Some nan value exists in feature 6 (ex)…?)->So, feature6 is not integer object type.
16 values are ‘?’ So, we replace ‘?’ to np.nan value. (Because its’s trash data)
